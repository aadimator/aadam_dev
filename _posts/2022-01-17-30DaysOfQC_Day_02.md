The second day of the challenge was relatively more productive as I'm starting to figure out a workflow that works for me. I completed the last freely available pathway, [Measurement](https://black.q-ctrl.com/skill/measurement), on the Black Opal platform. I also started reading the [Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing](http://www.thomaswong.net/introduction-to-classical-and-quantum-computing.pdf) book by Thomas Wong.

# Lessons learned

The Measurement Pathway consisted of 4 key topics, explaining the problem of measurement in quantum computing. We learned how a measurement will always result in one of the two possible computational states based on some probability, defined by the state of the qubit before the measurement. We saw how there are two types of movements: smooth rotations because of the application of quantum gates, and discontinuous movement because of the measurement. We also say how important the timing of performing the measurement is as it governs the probability of obtaining the desired results.

We learned about the **Born rule** which states that the probability of collapsing to $\ket 0$ when the state upon measurement is $\ket \psi$ is exactly $\vert\alpha\vert^2$. Similarly, the probability of collapsing to $\ket 1$ is $\vert\beta\vert^2$. We saw that a phase $\phi$ has no effect on the probability of collapsing to a particular state. We briefly learned about the **logical qubits** that are used to mitigate the effect of **noise** in quantum computing.

We also saw how to perceive the state of a qubit as humans. Different methodologies can be used in different physical systems to learn about the state of qubit. In the end, we learned about the philosophical reasonings and the many theories that try to explain the quantum phenomenon, and concluded by saying that we don't really need to know what a qubit really is in order to utilize it for computation.

# Moving forward

I'm now beginning to have a better system for my note-taking setup. I'm primarily using [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) as my reference manager and PDF Reader/Annotator. For note-taking, I'm using the amazing [Obsidian App](http://obsidian.md/). I'll write a detailed article (or maybe a YouTube video) showcasing my setup and automation processes.

Now, I'm reading the [Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing](http://www.thomaswong.net/introduction-to-classical-and-quantum-computing.pdf) book by Thomas Wong. I'm thinking about using the amazing [Excalidraw plugin](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) by [Zsolt Viczi√°n](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC0gns4a9fhVkGkngvSumAQ/featured) to take visual notes so I can share those with you guys. Let's see how that goes.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to comment below. Talk to you tomorrow, InshaAllah.

# PDF Notes

I'm posting all the notes I've taken from the 3 Pathways on Black Opal, because I haven't posted them previously (Only for the 2nd Pathway in [Day 1](./2022-01-16-30DaysOfQC_Day_01.md)).
