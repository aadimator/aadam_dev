It feels really great to see my progress, and more importantly, my consistency during this challenge. I’m almost finished with the challenge. Just a week or so left. After that, I’ll probably start another round. But first, let’s discuss what I did these past $10$ days or so, and why I didn’t update my blog in the meanwhile.

# Lessons learned

I’m finally done with the [Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing - Thomas Wong](http://www.thomaswong.net/introduction-to-classical-and-quantum-computing.pdf). It was a great read, an amazing introductory resource. I’ll write a detailed review of the book in a separate blogpost so I’ll skip my ravings for now. Here I’ll just briefly mention what I learned these past few days.

In the fifth chapter of the book, we were introduced to the amazing ecosystem by IBM for quantum programming and simulation, and we learned about `OpenQASM`, which is a programming language for writing quantum circuits. We also coded some simple programs in `Qiskit`, which is a Python toolkit for writing programs for quantum computers. We also briefly saw some other programming languages that are being used in the industry and their ecosystem.

In chapter 6, we learned about the **Entanglement** in detail, the difference between maximally entangled and partially entangled states, and various applications of this phenomenon in practical quantum computing algorithms. We learned about the bell inequalities, their history, and the different theories for the explanation of quantum mechanics. We then learned about some important applications of entanglement, like superdense coding, quantum teleportation, and quantum key distribution.

The chapter 7 was all about quantum algorithms. We first learned about the ideas of circuit complexity and query complexity as they can be used to determine how efficient a quantum algorithm is as compared to its classical counterpart. We were then given a brief introduction of the various problems, their classical solutions (along with their complexities) and their quantum solutions. The quantum algorithms included Deutsch’s Algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm, Simon’s Algorithm, Grover’s Algorithm, Quantum Fourier Transform, and Shor’s Algorithm among others.

The last chapter was all about some future directions to get a job and have a better and deeper understanding of the technical concepts of quantum computing and quantum mechanics. You can find my notes on the whole book here: [notes.aadimator.com](https://notes.aadimator.com/%F0%9F%93%9A%20books/%F0%9F%93%9A%20introduction%20to%20classical%20and%20quantum%20computing%20-%20thomas%20wong/%F0%9F%93%9D%20introduction%20to%20classical%20and%20quantum%20computing%20-%20thomas%20wong/#by-chapters)

# Moving forward

Now, let’s talk about why I didn’t write any blogpost this past week. Well, the simple answer is that my [notes](https://notes.aadimator.com) website was up. Previously, whenever I completed a chapter, I wanted to share the PDF notes with you guys, so I wrote a small blogpost outlining what I learned along with the notes. Now that I’ve moved on to Web Notes, there’s not much need for a blogpost. I use [twitter](https://twitter.com/aadimator) for my daily progress updates. So, moving forward, I’ll only share a blogpost when I’m done with a milestone (like today I finished Thomas Wong’s book), or when I have something substantial to say about my journey and how I’m planning to move forward. There’s no point in writing a blogpost just to say “hey guys, I read a few pages of this book today!”.

I have also started the Coursera Specialization, [Quantum Computing: from Basics to the Cutting Edge](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/quantum-computing-from-basics-to-the-cutting-edge), and I’ll update once I’m done with that. I’m also thinking about participating in the [QHack 2022](https://qhack.ai/) and I need to hone my programming skills for that. So I’ll most probably be focusing on the [Qiskit Resources](https://qiskit.org/textbook-beta) and [Xanadu Codebook](https://codebook.xanadu.ai/) as well. Furthermore, I’m really interested in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), so I’ll start some book/course on that as well. I’ll post updates on Twitter as I progress through this.
