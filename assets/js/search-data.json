            "content": "I have successfully completed the Chapter 1, Classical Information and Computation, of the Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing book by Thomas Wong. This concludes the introduction to the basic concepts from the classical computing. Next, we‚Äôll start with the Quantum bits. . . Lessons learned . Day 3 of #30DaysOfQC: Reading the Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing book by [@]thomasgwong (let&#39;s not tag the good professor in this again). Halfway through the first chapter. Taking notes takes up most of the time. Also, spent a major portion of the day fixing up . &mdash; Aadam (@aadimator) January 18, 2022 We started off by learning about Bits and how different physical systems can be used to represent a bit. We then learned how all the information, from text to images and videos, can be represented by using just two numbers, $0$ and $1$. After that, we saw how to process and manipulate bits using Logic Gates, such as NOT Gate, AND Gate, OR Gate, NAND Gate, and so on. We also learned about the idea of Universal Logic Gate Sets and Universal Logic Gates, i.e. Gates that can be used to perform all possible logic operations. . Next, we looked at Adders to see how addition is performed using Binary Numbers. We first looked at the Half-Adder along with Verilog Code and then we learned about the Full Adder with code and circuit diagrams. We then saw how half and full adders can be combined to form a Ripple-Carry Adder that can perform binary additions. After that we learned about the circuit complexity and how it can be reduced using Boolean Algebra. We also learned about the Reversible and Irreversible Logic Gates and saw how we can create Reversible Logic gate from an irreversible one (e.g. Toffoli Gate from AND Gate). . We then learned about how to detect if an error has occurred, because of a single-event upset or during transmission, and how and when to correct that error. This will be helpful when we learn about error correction in quantum computing later on. In the end, we learned about the asymptotic notation and different computational complexity classes (P, NP, NP-COMPLETE, PSPACE, BQP), and finished off by learning about the Turing Machines, the Church-Turing Thesis, and the hope that quantum computers will be able to violate the Strong Church-Turing Thesis. . Day 4 of #30DaysOfQC: Finished the first chapter of the textbook (with complete notes). It was all about classical computing. The next chapter will be about #QuantumComputing. I&#39;ll share my notes on: https://t.co/7Bxc8hh2k4 . &mdash; Aadam (@aadimator) January 19, 2022 . Moving forward . I spent a large amount of time yesterday to try to fix my Notes website so I can share my notes with you, which you can explore interactively. Some dependency issues with Gatsby took up a lot of my time and reminded me why I hate JavaScript üòï. For now, I‚Äôll try not to spend so much time on this and try to focus on the actual task of learning and note-taking. . As far as the daily blog post is concerned, I‚Äôm not so sure if I should do it daily as there‚Äôs not much to write about. Like for Day 3, I was only half-way through the first chapter and I wanted to share my complete first chapters notes with you, so I decided to skip the day and share the progress on Blog once the notes are complete. I‚Äôll be following this strategy moving forward. Although I‚Äôll update my progress daily on Twitter, I will only be posting on my blog when I have something to share, maybe after a week to outline my progress throughout that week. . .

            "content": "The second day of the challenge was relatively more productive as I‚Äôm starting to figure out a workflow that works for me. I completed the last freely available pathway, Measurement, on the Black Opal platform. I also started reading the Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing book by Thomas Wong. . . Lessons learned . The Measurement Pathway consisted of 4 key topics, explaining the problem of measurement in quantum computing. We learned how a measurement will always result in one of the two possible computational states based on some probability, defined by the state of the qubit before the measurement. We saw how there are two types of movements: smooth rotations because of the application of quantum gates, and discontinuous movement because of the measurement. We also say how important the timing of performing the measurement is as it governs the probability of obtaining the desired results. . We learned about the Born rule which states that the probability of collapsing to $ ket 0$ when the state upon measurement is $ ket psi$ is exactly $ vert alpha vert^2$. Similarly, the probability of collapsing to $ ket 1$ is $ vert beta vert^2$. We saw that a phase $ phi$ has no effect on the probability of collapsing to a particular state. We briefly learned about the logical qubits that are used to mitigate the effect of noise in quantum computing. . We also saw how to perceive the state of a qubit as humans. Different methodologies can be used in different physical systems to learn about the state of qubit. In the end, we learned about the philosophical reasonings and the many theories that try to explain the quantum phenomenon, and concluded by saying that we don‚Äôt really need to know what a qubit really is in order to utilize it for computation. . Day 2 of #30DaysOfQC: Finished the last freely available path on Black Opal. It was a very thought-provoking, informative, and entertaining experience. Thanks, @qctrlHQ for such a great introductory resource. Only if I could continue with this üò• but sadly, financial reasons üòï pic.twitter.com/enSR4jdWFA . &mdash; Aadam (@aadimator) January 17, 2022 . Moving forward . I‚Äôm now beginning to have a better system for my note-taking setup. I‚Äôm primarily using Zotero as my reference manager and PDF Reader/Annotator. For note-taking, I‚Äôm using the amazing Obsidian App. I‚Äôll write a detailed article (or maybe a YouTube video) showcasing my setup and automation processes. . Now, I‚Äôm reading the Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing book by Thomas Wong. I‚Äôm thinking about using the amazing Excalidraw plugin by Zsolt Viczi√°n to take visual notes so I can share those with you guys. Let‚Äôs see how that goes. . .

            "content": "First day wasn‚Äôt as productive as I would‚Äôve liked. Instead of dedicating most of my time to the actual task of the challenge, i.e. learning about Quantum Computing, I spent most of it on trying to create a YouTube video introducing the challenge. There was also occasional load shedding happening throughout the day, which disrupted my flow, but still, I managed to complete the Qubit Pathway on the Black Opal platform. I also started reading the Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing book by Thomas Wong, during the load shedding hours. . . Lessons learned . The Black Opal‚Äôs Qubit Pathway is divided into 5 subsections and taught about how to encode and process information using quantum physics. First we learned about the three fundamental types of quantitative data, i.e. analog, digital, and quantum. We also learned about how measuring the state of a qubit destroys the state and collapses it into either of a computational state based on some probability. We learned about the noise in quantum computing, which is when the surrounding environment of the qubit tries to alter/read the data, resulting in unexpected outcomes/states, and why this is the biggest challenge in Quantum Computing. We learned about the ‚Äúno-gos‚Äù in quantum computing, i.e. the thing which we can do in classical computing but aren‚Äôt possible in quantum computing, such as ‚Äúno-cloning‚Äù, which means that quantum data cannot be copied or cloned. We also briefly learned about the plus-state $ ket +$, ‚Äúminus-state‚Äù: $ ket - = ket 0 - ket 1$, and the concept of Entanglement. . Later on, we learned about the Bloch circle, which is a simplification of the Bloch sphere, and acts as a stepping stone to have a better understanding of the Bloch sphere. We learned about Quantum Gates which, when applied to a qubit, change its state from one place to another. After that, we learned about the $ ket{ket}$ notation, which is a compact, abstract way to represent the states of a qubit. And finally, we learned about the Bloch sphere, and how it connects everything together, i.e. kets, vectors, trigonometry, quantum states. We learned about the common set of gates ${X,Y,H,Z,S,T}$ and how the perform simple rotations on the state of the qubit on the bloch sphere. . Day 1 of #30DaysOfQC: Even though I was really tired because of the video editing today, I still managed to complete a pathway on Black Opalü•≥ Tomorrow, I&#39;ll complete the last of the freely available paths and write a quick review (hopefully YT video as well).#QuantumComputing pic.twitter.com/AUTMjL6eiE . &mdash; Aadam (@aadimator) January 16, 2022 . Going forward . I‚Äôm not sure how and if I can incorporate YouTube videos into this challenge. Yesterday, that took up a major portion of my time, but given that it was my first time trying this and I wasn‚Äôt sure how to proceed, which tool to use (After Effects, manim, PowerPoint, Premiere Pro), which style to follow, it‚Äôs understandable that it would take more time. Now, I have somewhat of a better idea about how to proceed, and it‚Äôll improve day by day. But the thing is, I‚Äôm not so sure if that would be an effective use of my time. . I can‚Äôt work on educational videos, explaining a topic in detail, as that would require a huge amount of time to setup. I can only think of creating a video, scrolling through the notes I‚Äôve taken and summarizing, but that won‚Äôt be much use to anyone (except me of course). Or maybe, I can dedicate a day of the week, where I‚Äôll create a detailed animated video, explaining a concept in detail, or maybe a weekly video showcasing my progress on a particular week. Let‚Äôs see how and if I should proceed with YouTube video format. . If you have any suggestions, feel free to comment below. See you tomorrow, InshaAllah. .

            "title": "My 30 Days of Quantum Computing Challenge",
            "content": "Introduction . I have been meaning to delve deeper into the spooky realm of Quantum Computing for a while now, but every time some other distraction (Deep learning, Reinforcement learning, Julia, ML Competitions etc.) diverts my attention. This time, I‚Äôve decided to stick with the plan and see this through to the end. This #30DaysOfQC challenge is a measure to make it more probable, InshaAllah. . . What is #30DaysOfQC Challenge? . Much like the #30DaysOfCode challenge, where the participants strive to code for 30 consecutive days, I‚Äôll be committing to learning about Quantum Computing for minimum 1 hour every day for the next 30 days. This includes both the theory, as well as the practical aspect of it. Same as the #30DaysOfCode challenge, I‚Äôll be publicly posting my progress; on Twitter, this blog, and YouTube (hopefully üôÑ). . For the sake of public accountability, I&#39;ll be posting my progress (and brief notes) on learning #QuantumComputing for the next 30 days. Wish me luck ü§û#30DaysQC . &mdash; Aadam (@aadimator) January 15, 2022 Why I‚Äôm doing this? . There are a number of reasons for this, both internal and external. . Public accountability . By committing to this task publicly, I‚Äôve made a promise to all of you. This motivates me to go through with this to the end. Otherwise, I‚Äôd be going back on my word and will lose the respect and confidence of others. I have found this to be a powerful incentive to stick with some thing. Hopefully, this will work this time as well, InshaAllah. . A better understanding . Another powerful reason behind this challenge is The Feynman Technique, which states that to better understand a topic, you have to teach it to someone else as well. I know that was a crude oversimplification, but the point being, teaching and explaining a concept in simple terms helps in having a better understanding of the topic. By committing to writing a small blog post/twitter thread/YouTube video explaining what I learned that day, I‚Äôll helping myself along the way, forcing myself to a have deeper understanding of the topic in order to not mess up the teaching/explaining aspect. . Daily log . This will also act as a daily log, highlighting the the path I took and the progress I made along my learning journey. This will be beneficial for both future me as well as others who might want to start this journey sometime in the future. This would give them a lay of the quantum land and help them in devising a better path (learning from my mistakes). . How I‚Äôm going about doing this? . I haven‚Äôt devised a concrete learning path for this yet, and I don‚Äôt believe doing that would be helpful. I‚Äôll pick things up along the way, based on the feedback of others, and my own level of understanding. . For the time being, I‚Äôm thinking about first completing the free pathways on Black Opal site, as they are very easy to digest and their interactive visualizations and exercises are really helpful to drive a point home. After that, I‚Äôll start the book by Thomas Wong, Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing. Then, I‚Äôm not sure if I should go the Mike and Ike route, or I should learn more about Quantum Machine Learning. Or maybe I should explore the amazing resources (textbooks and courses) by Qiskit and/or Xanadu Quantum Codebook. Only time will tell. . . So, that‚Äôs the plan for the next 30 days, InshaAllah. Thirty days, filled with Quantum Spookiness and inspiration. Wish me luck üôÇ .",

            "title": "PyTorch Scholarship Challenge from Facebook",
            "content": "I got accepted into the PyTorch Scholarship Challenge program, offered by Facebook, which focuses on teaching Deep Learning using the PyTorch framework. . There were two phases of this challenge. In Phase 1, they selected about 10,000 students worldwide to participate in the challenge. Out of those 10,000 students, only 300 would be selected for Phase 2, in which they‚Äôd have access to the complete Deep Learning Nanodegree for free. . As I was planning to learn the Pytorch framework and was looking for some amazing tutorials to get started, naturally I was very excited when I got selected into the Pytorch Scholarship Challenge Phase 1. My previous experience with Udacity‚Äôs Nanodegree programs was very rewarding in which I completed 3 Nanodegree programs, namely Machine Learning Engineer, Android Basics and Android Developer. But that was before they changed their pricing model, from monthly subscription to a one-time up-front payment system. After that, they also changed their teaching methods somewhat and instead of self-paced learning, they turned these Nanodegree programs into a schedule-based class type program. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd enjoy this as much, but I did, a lot. . The video content of the program was absolutely amazing, as always. The production quality, the teaching efficiency, the animations to easily understand the content, the topic selection, everything was spot on. The programming exercises also helped cement what we learned in the class. The final challenge made us realize how much we actually understood about the concepts and techniques taught in the course. . It was a fun experience. Now, all this, I expected beforehand, nothing extraordinary. This is all very great of course, but it wasn‚Äôt the main thing that blew my mind. What made this a memorable experience and quite unique frankly, was the social aspect and the engagement with the community. From the start of the class, the Udacity team created a Slack workspace for the participants of this challenge and encouraged everyone to participate in group discussions. There was a Facebook group as well, but I mostly used the Slack workspace, and I think so did most of the other students because it was fairly active all the time. It was hard to keep track of all the things and activities going on at a given moment but still, it was manageable. . A team of TAs and volunteers were always present to solve the queries of the students and help them out if they‚Äôre struggling with something, be it a concept taught in the course, a program, an environment error, cutting-edge new research and so on. I mean there were always interesting and informative conversations happening and the vibe of the whole community was very positive. . They also took several initiatives to further help the community, like Study Buddy, Mentor-ship program, study groups, workshops etc. Many study groups were made, based on the interests of the students, or their geographical location etc. Every weekend, the members of the study group would meet, either locally or through hangout, if they‚Äôre far apart, and discuss what they learned, ask questions, help-out each other. They would later on post their group selfies in the Facebook group which also motivated others to do so. You know how people are these days üòâ . A number of extra workshops were held as well, both by Udacity professionals as well as the student participants of the program. They would cover a wide range of topics. Some would explain the concepts taught in the course that the students were having a hard time understanding. Some would show how to debug or troubleshoot a certain kind of problem that the students are having. Some would explain other interesting topics, not covered in the course. Everybody was willing to help out each other and in the process, learn and grow, together as a community. . This social engagement aspect made a very positive impact on me. This will definitely be one of the most memorable and rewarding experiences of my life, given the toxicity of most of the online communities. . . I have good news as well, great news in fact. I got accepted into the Phase 2 program. I will be able to complete the Deep Learning Nanodegree program, which I was very very eager to do, but couldn‚Äôt afford. I am planning to blog about my experience with the Nanodegree as well as the content that I learn there. So, look out for some amazing tutorials and blog posts on Deep Learning and stay tuned.

            "content": "Yeah, I know I‚Äôve been inactive these past couple of months. I was busy with some other things and quite frankly, I wasn‚Äôt really in the mood to watch any more lectures or complete any more courses. I guess I was in the hibernation mode but hopefully that period is over now. . I came across this specialization from Google on Coursera, Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform Specialization, and I‚Äôve got to say, I was really excited to stumble upon this one as I was struggling with understanding how to implement the Machine Learning models and techniques I‚Äôve learned in courses like Machine Learning and Deep Learning Specialization, where the focus was on understanding the mathematical concepts behind these models and the tips and tricks to make them more efficient and to effectively train them, while in this specialization from Google, it seemed that there focus will be on using these models in a production environment. Just the thing I wanted. . I‚Äôve finished first course in the specialization till now, How Google does Machine Learning, and I‚Äôm half way through the second course. In the first course, they introduced us to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and showed how to start a VM instance and how to use the Data Lab to quickly spin out an instance for Machine Learning and Data Science related tasks. We also completed a few labs to get hands-on practice with the GCP platform and to see how it all works. . . Although the lecture videos are very well made and informative, the thing that I love about this specialization is QwikLabs. The good people of Google have provided the students with free cloud credits in the form of QwikLabs so we could get hands-on practice with the GCP and try out what we are learning in the course. If we had to spend our own credits to try-out things in the GCP, then I‚Äôm positive that most of us would‚Äôve just watched the videos and leave out practice for some other day. This initiative to give out sandbox environments for learning purposes is much appreciated. . I‚Äôve been quite satisfied with this specialization up til now. The videos have been quite easy to follow Although they don‚Äôt go into the nitty gritty details about how the algorithms work on a mathematical level, but then again, that‚Äôs not the focus of this specialization. I‚Äôll publish an article upon completing this specialization to tell you about my experience regarding this specialization. And yeah, one more thing, there will be a part two of this specialization also, at least that‚Äôs what they said. So, looking forward to that as well. Let‚Äôs see how it goes.

Note: This isn‚Äôt supposed to be a complete list of resources for Machine Learning. You can find those on the web easily. This will only list the resources that I used and found valuable. . Books . Throughout my life, I‚Äôve found books to be the most valuable resource that one could have in order to better understand a topic. Online courses are a good resource to give a general introduction to wet your appetite but in order to satisfy your craving to learn more and in detail, books are the best things you could ask for. . A Course in Machine Learning . . This books gives a general introduction to the different algorithms being used in the Machine Learning. Instead of relying heavily on math to explain the concepts, it uses ideas and models from the real-world. You can download this book for free although there is a catch, this book is a work in progress so some parts of the book and the algorithms might not have been written as of yet. But still, I highly recommend this book. . Machine Learning in Action . . This book follows a more hands-on approach with Python programs accompanying different Machine Learning algorithms to further solidify the concepts. I find this way of teaching more effective as one could easily test out different algorithms and experiment with them to see what works and how. I haven‚Äôt completed this book as of yet but I‚Äôm planning to do so in the near future. . Courses . Though books provide an in-depth knowledge about a certain topic, they aren‚Äôt as effective as Video lectures when starting out. Video lectures are good for starting out in a new field or subject as they give a broad overview of the field and they are a more interactive medium for teaching about new concepts. . Udacity . The Machine Learning Nanodegree offered by Udacity is one of the best resource for learning Machine Learning. The video lectures are well-structured and easy to understand. And the most important thing is the Projects that one have to complete in order to graduate from the Nanodegree. These projects help a lot in understanding the concepts that one is learning about by implementing them in some real-world scenario and seeing how it works. . You can also use Free Courses instead of buying the whole Nanodegree program which might be a little expensive for some. The only drawback is that you won‚Äôt have access to the Projects but you can watch the Courses begin taught in the Nanodegree, free of cost. . Coursera Machine Learning . This course, taught by Andrew Ng, is one of the few courses that manages to explain some of the most technical and math-heavy concepts in Machine Learning in an intuitive and easy-to-understand manner. Instead of shying away from using scary mathematical equations, it explains them in such a way that one starts wondering how come he didn‚Äôt get that before. . . I will update this as I learn more resources, so keep an eye out for more goodies. .",

I knew, because of the popularity and the numerous positive reviews, that this course is going to be a good one but every time, there came a new MOOC on some new subject that I‚Äôve been waiting for and I rushed towards it. . . But now, as Andrew Ng released a new specialization on Deep Learning, which I am dying to start next, I was motivated enough to finish this course because I thought that this will prove to be an invaluable resource and a firm foundation for the topics that will be covered in the Deep Learning Specialization. . I was amazed to find out that this course has proven to be a lot more rewarding than I imagined it to be. All the material was carefully selected and intuitively explained. Andrew Ng is one of the best teachers that I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure to learn from. His way of explaining difficult and complex concepts so easily and intuitively is extraordinary. A lot of topics, that were quite difficult to comprehend before, seemed so easy to understand after Andrew‚Äôs explanation that I wondered why I didn‚Äôt get it before. . Who is this for? . Is this course worth 11 Weeks of my life? What should I expect to get out of this course? . If you are serious about learning Machine Learning and want to dig deeper to understand the inner working of the algorithms, then this course is the perfect fit for you. This course is a lot older than most of the Machine Learning courses being offered today but it does a pretty good job of explaining the basic concepts in order to better understand the Machine Learning algorithms being used nowadays. . If you only want to get a general overview of how Machine Learning works and to learn some library or tool to perform basic Machine Learning tasks then you are better off using some other resource e.g. Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree by Udacity. . It‚Äôs not that this course isn‚Äôt good or won‚Äôt benefit you, it‚Äôs just that it has a different audience in mind. It caters to more technical minded persons. It heavily uses Mathematics to explain the algorithms. You need to have a basic understanding of Linear Algebra and Calculus in order to make an intuition about the inner workings of the algorithms. All the assignments are in MATLAB, unlike most of the new Machine Learning courses which use Python. . . I highly recommend this course as this was very beneficial for me. I learned a lot of new things and most of all, it cleared a lot of confusions and misconceptions that I had about some learning algorithms. I knew how to use those algorithms but I didn‚Äôt understand how they were working. Just like using a magic spell, I replicated what someone else said would work without understanding why this is working which frustrated me a lot. This course demystified a lot of things for me. Now I‚Äôll be able to use Machine Learning techniques and algorithms knowing why and how this is working which will help me a lot in experimenting with new techniques and testing out new ideas. . I‚Äôm still confused about some algorithms, more specifically the back-propagation algorithm, but in my defense, it is one of the most complex algorithms in Machine Learning according to Andrew Ng. I understand intuitively how and why back-propagation works but I‚Äôm a little confused about the Maths behind the algorithm. Guess I have to watch the videos again, once or twice. . . I‚Äôve started the Deep Learning Specialization also offered by Andrew Ng on Cousera. I‚Äôm on the last week of Neural Networks and Deep Learning, the first course in the specialization. I‚Äôll tell you about my experience with this course in the upcoming post, Insha Allah. .",

            "content": "A while back, I started the Deep Learning course provided by fast.ai and after going through the first few lessons, I felt like I needed to brush up on my Machine Learning skills first if I want to get a deeper understanding of the Deep Learning. It wasn‚Äôt that they were going at an extra pace or were covering hard mathematical problems and complex algorithms, but they did require us to learn some material on our own, by reading articles or watching some videos or simulations etc. . Anyways, I decided to put the fast.ai course on hold for a while and complete a few courses on Machine Learning first. It‚Äôs not that I didn‚Äôt have any Machine Learning experience before taking that course. . . I‚Äôve completed the Machine Learning Nanodegree offered by Udacity. It was an amazing experience as I learned a lot of new things and had some hands-on experience, with the problems we face in machine learning and the libraries, tools and the algorithms that are mostly used to solve those problems, by completing several projects. My Capstone Project was related to a Computer Vision problem, the famous dogs-vs-cats classification problem, and I solved it using CNN. So, I had a little bit of experience with Deep Learning as well. . Nonetheless, I still wanted to explore Machine Learning a bit further and to get more comfortable with it. I had a few courses on my mind that were better suited for my situation and on top was the Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng. I had started this course half an year ago, but because of some forgettable reasons, I wasn‚Äôt able to complete it. . This was the perfect course for me as I had some experience with Machine Learning but I didn‚Äôt fully understand some of the algorithms and the techniques we used. This course provided just that, a little more detail as to why we do such and such and why and how this works. The teaching style of Andrew Ng was phenomenal, the way he could explain difficult concepts without dumbing them down. . You can‚Äôt imagine my surprise when I found out today that Andrew Ng released 5 new courses on Deep Learning, the Deep Learning Specialization. . . Given the quality of the first Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng and the positive feedback it got, chances are that this specialization is going to be quite amazing as well. . This gave me extra motivation to complete the Machine Learning course first and then delve into this specialization to whet my appetite. By looking at the first two weeks, I am positive that this is going to be a very rewarding experience for me. .",

            "title": "Begin Robotics‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFirst Week Review",
            "content": "After dabbling in Machine Learning and Deep Learning for a few months, I‚Äôve decided to dip my toes into the field of Robotics. My favorite pastime is to learn about new things and to explore the uncharted territory. For now, my heart is set on learning about the Robots, getting a general overview as to how they perform their functions and how to train and build a robot. . I‚Äôm not very enthusiastic about the hardware side of the robots but the software, the soul that drives them. In order to create better software for the robots, having a broad overview of their workings is imperative. For that purpose, I decided to take a few introductory courses on robotics. . After checking out several courses on Class Central, I chose Begin Robotics because it seemed to be perfect for me, just the right amount of information. It wasn‚Äôt focused on just a single aspect, hardware or software, but how different pieces interact with one another. No prior knowledge was required and no hardware or software was necessary to complete the course. Furthermore, the quality of the course also seemed to be better than some other MOOCs. . . After completing the first week, I‚Äôm happy that I chose this course. The quality of the content is remarkable without being too technical and hard to understand. Their teaching methodology is incredible, some well thought-out video lectures to lure you in, a few articles to whet your appetite, and to top it off the interactive exercises work wonders. . These interactive exercises are very beneficial in order to understand the concepts taught in the lectures. By tweaking some variables and observing how it affects the performance and behavior of the robots, one gets a good understanding of the underlying principles. Besides a few UX problems, I‚Äôve been content with these exercises, loving them even. . Another thing that I find helpful is the community there. Most of the discussions there are very insightful and have a positive vibe which encourages participation. This is my first MOOC from FutureLearn and I find their site design to be more user-friendly than Coursera and EdX, especially their discussion forum feature. Unlike Coursera, where we have to go to separate discussion form and search in separate threads, all the discussions related to a certain video or article are right there on the same page in FutureLearn. The Coursera discussion forms also have their own importance and their organization structure is also good but I find the FutureLearn‚Äôs discussion forms structure to be easier and more helpful. . I am quite optimistic that this MOOC will be an amazing experience for me. I‚Äôll learn a lot of new things and have a lot of fun along the way. .",

            "content": "Recently, as I was working on Odoo, I came across a problem when I wanted to print a report. It was generating the HTML report just fine but when I wanted to download that report, it was having difficulty converting that report into PDF. Basically, the version of wkhtmltopdf library wasn‚Äôt compatible with the current setup. . I tried various solutions that I could find on the internet but none worked for me except the one I‚Äôm about to document here. Most of the solutions suggested that installing the wkhtmltopdf version 0.12.1, which is the recommended version from Odoo, would solve the issue but I wasn‚Äôt able to install it either as I was using Ubuntu 16.04 and some of the dependencies that were required to install the library weren‚Äôt supported. . Here‚Äôs what worked for me: . First of all, remove the previous version of wkhtmltopdf that‚Äôs already installed on your system. | . sudo apt-get remove wkhtmltopdf sudo apt-get autoremove . Then go to the official site of wkhtmltopdf and download the latest version from there. | . wget https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/releases/download/0.12.4/wkhtmltox-0.12.4_linux-generic-amd64.tar.xz . After that, unzip the file using this command. | . tar -xf {file_name} . Now, copy the files from the extracted folder into the /usr/bin/ as this is the directory where Odoo looks for wkhtmltopdf. | . sudo cp wkhtmltox/bin/wkhtmltoimage /usr/bin/ sudo cp wkhtmltox/bin/wkhtmltopdf /usr/bin/ . Restart your Odoo Server now. Everything should be working fine. | . By following these steps, I was able to solve the problem at hand and hopefully, these will work for you too. Do let me know if it works. .",

            "title": "Fast.ai - Initial Thoughts",
            "content": "For a long time now, I‚Äôve been planning to start learning about the deep learning, but whenever I start reading about it, either through books such as The MIT Press Deep Learning book, or through some online video or MOOCs, I get bombarded with strange mathematical formulas and complex equations. Of course this complex mathematics is quite necessary to understand Deep Learning models but it also repels a beginner from learning about this field, as a beginner is more result oriented. . If I was a PhD student and I was researching to make a specific algorithm perform better in some way, sure I‚Äôd have to learn about all those equations and formulas, but the reality is, I‚Äôm not, for now. I am just a curious student, who‚Äôd like to get a general overview about how Deep Learning works and build some apps to test different models on the real world data. . But for a long time, most of the resources available to learn about Deep Learning were focusing on those PhD level students, quite boring and technical, with little to no practical projects whatsoever. So, whenever I tried starting this endeavor to learn about Deep Learning, just after a day or two, I‚Äôd get frustrated and abandon it altogether. . You can‚Äôt imagine my surprise when I learned about this course, fast.ai, taught by Jeremy Howard. The approach that they are using to teach Deep Learning is quite opposite to what‚Äôs being used elsewhere. Instead of diving deeper into the technicalities from the start, they are using a top-down code-first approach where they let the student experiment with different algorithms and techniques by implementing them to solve real world problems, like from Kaggle competitions etc, from the first lecture. . This is what I‚Äôve been looking for all along. A way to ease into the Deep Learning field, experiment with different models, and when I get comfortable then delve deeper into the mathematics. . The main objective or the teaching strategy being followed by Jeremy in this course seems quite interesting and attractive but let‚Äôs see how effective it is and how well it is executed. . I‚Äôm hopeful that this is going to be an amazing experience for me, I‚Äôll learn a lot and practice a lot. I‚Äôll keep blogging about my experience taking this course, the things I liked, the things I didn‚Äôt, the problems I faced and solutions to those. Let‚Äôs see how it turns out. .",

          "title": "About Me",
          "content": "as-salƒÅmu  øalaykum (peace be upon you). I‚Äôm Aadam and welcome to my blog. I‚Äôm a machine learning engineer, motion designer, illustrator, and an all-around nerd. I‚Äôm super excited to share what I‚Äôm learning here on this blog. I‚Äôm also available for freelance work as well. Feel free to contact me if you want. . I started this blog for two purposes: to write about what I‚Äôm learning in my own words, and to share my perspectives and reflections with others and my future self. The former reason serves mainly to reinforce what I‚Äôm learning (you don‚Äôt really know something unless you can teach it!), while the latter is simply a way for me to share what reflections I‚Äôve found helpful for me and store a snapshot of my views over the course of my life. Many of the blog posts are a living document, so I‚Äôll come back and edit things, add new info, switch out the graphics, etc. These are also pretty informal posts, more of a quick brain dump than a work of literary art. . In all honesty, this is more of a journal than a blog, but I‚Äôve chosen to make this journal public in the case of a) the content can help someone else and b) someone disagrees and we can have a discussion. I‚Äôm a big believer in open, frank critique of ideas and I believe the best way to grow an idea is to attack it. Don‚Äôt take what I write on here for granted - ask yourself if what I‚Äôm talking about makes sense to you. If it doesn‚Äôt, speak up! Let‚Äôs have a discussion. . A little about myself . I love to program. I love the thrill, the adrenaline rush after solving a complex problem. I participated in several Speed Programming competitions held throughout the country, representing my University during my Bachelor years. . I‚Äôm a huge adventurer, and I love to travel. I‚Äôve traveled to the northern areas of Pakistan, like Naaraan, Khaghan, Murree etc. The 8+ hours long journey, across the ragged mountains and slippery pathways, to reach the Ansuu Jheel is one of the most memorable moments of my life. . I love reading books. From fantasy novels; like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter; to self-help books, from Science to Literature, I‚Äôve read quite a few. I also like to binge-watch drama series sometimes (quite a lot frankly). I like to play Table Tennis and I‚Äôve won several competition as well, representing my University as well as my district. . My interests span from engineering to design to neuroscience and many fields in between - my curiosity fuels an insatiable love for learning new things. I‚Äôm also fascinated by entrepreneurship and wish to make my impact through creating businesses that add value to our society. . . Connect with me . Site Link .
